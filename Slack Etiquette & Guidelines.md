# RChain Slack - Etiquette & Guidelines


## Overview  

The RChain slack channel (ourchain.slack.com) is a tool to enable real-time cooperation and collaboration that will further the progression of the RChain platform and ecosystem. 

It’s important to us that the individuals who are driving results for the RChain community feel comfortable engaging with the community regularly. Therefore:

## **Some things that we greatly appreciate:**
 
- personal introductions in #general 
- channel specific conversations (rholang in #rholang, governance in #community-governance) 
- citing of sources of information and reference 
  
## **Some things we strongly encourage:**

- ideation with community members for the RChain platform and dApps 
- due diligence of [RChain platform documentation](https://github.com/rchain/reference) 
- thoughtful feedback expressed live during [Wednesday debriefs](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSS3jCffMiz574_q64Ukj_w) 
- formal proposals for solutions to community problems  
- the transformation of conversations, into hangouts, into proposals, into teams and into solutions  
  
## **Some things that a moderator will warn against:**

- repeating claims on an individual’s character and intentions due to lack of information 
- the repeated spreading of misinformation  
- the repeated disruption of constructive conversations 
- rude and offensive language 
- spamming multiple channels with off-topic or offensive content 
  
## **Some things for which we will reluctantly remove accounts:**

- habitual disregard of guidelines for strongly discouraged activities above becoming disruptive to the community 
- neglect to abide by these guidelines despite multiple personal requests - public or private - from different active community members 
  
We will continually strive to create an environment where RChain grows rapidly and attracts top talent from around the world.


Cheers,

Rchain Team
