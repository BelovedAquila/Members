# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this project come to fruition.

We're establishing a community process for activists to earn RHOC working for the coop.

 - Work items are represented by [issues](https://github.com/rchain/Members/issues/)
   - To make one or join work on one, you need to:
     1. [ ] get/have a [Github account](https://github.com/rchain/Members)
     2. [ ] complete [RChain Activist Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecwGUVFNx_Xa_Qsw5bxLnaKstPS8kQnfrUGqpuf22rLDteDg/viewform)
       - [ ] then confirm the [collaboration invite](https://github.com/rchain/Members/invitations) for the repository [rchain/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members) 
 - Budgets are allocated to work items by at least three Activists
   - [ ] suggest a budget through form [Budget allocation and - spending](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfz-EGexMGPaw0eHwlBBNssQIR5hQCEOsWOZceVrPCo5mjGUA/viewform)
   - [ ] key activist will handle this suggestion [Pub Activist Budget Allocation-Spending](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxuxx8YN17KCIWcH1cUoGuSm2hAnIya2iAc6wxoaq1o/edit#gid=1168839067)
 - RHOC are distributed monthly based on invoices
   - [ ] During the month each collaborator decides how the budget in RHOC is distributed over the collaborators as a reward for the participation. Through form [Budget allocation and - spending](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfz-EGexMGPaw0eHwlBBNssQIR5hQCEOsWOZceVrPCo5mjGUA/viewform)
   - [ ] At the end of the month an invoice template will be generated and emailed to the collaborator
   - [ ] Sends an own invoice with that data through form [Declaration]. The invoice has to be stored as a PDF file in a personal [Gdrive of Rchain](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5I9qM5f_1cfeUZoV01EYjdmOEE)
   - [ ] As soon as ops@rchain.coop receives the invoice, the RHOC will transferred to  ETH-addresses. The invoice can also be emailed.

The first monthly cycle was Aug 2017. HJH (lapin7) presented this
