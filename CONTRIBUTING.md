# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need active developers to help this project come to fruition.

We're establishing a community process for Members to earn RHOC working for the coop. See video [24:06 HJ explains Members Decentralized Budgeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Li4g4qDF6M&t=1486s).


**Becoming a Member**

**Process**

- Get a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) account
- [Sign up](https://presale.rchain.coop/#/sign-up) for the Pre Sale and pay the $20 fee. You will be reimbursed the $20 if you've paid also during the PRE-membership process.
- Set a conference call time slot with a representative of RChain cooperative. During the conference call the representative tries to accomplish the 

**4 Membership requirements**:
- [Affirm Membership agreement](https://github.com/rchain/legaldocs/blob/master/Coop%20Membership%20Agreement.pdf)
- Photo of current govt issued ID
- Verified payment of membership fee
- Verify face on live video

**Promotion to MEMBER**

When the 4 Membership Requirements are completed and recorded, a Discord Moderator promotes the user to ROLE=MEMBER and append a ":" to the member's Discord alias for proof of individuality.

**Member Signup Portal**

This process is not in place yet, but it should make things easier. Navneet and Branko are working to enable the private-sale website for MEMBER signups. The site will collect payment, record users' contact information, ask them to affirm the Membership Agreement, and upload photo ID to a secure location. After payment, users are given a Discord invitation. 

On Discord, users may request a Live Verification from any online user whose name appears in red (Verifier) or green (Moderator ). Verifiers have access to the photo ID storage location, and to a shared spreadsheet where they share and record verification information.

**Pre-Paid via Portal**

Users who have already paid through the private-sale site, but who are not participating in the private-sale, should already have affirmed the membership agreement, received their paid Bitpay invoice# via email, as well as a Discord invitation. They can follow the Live Verification procedure above.

**Pre-Paid Activists**

Activists who have paid $20 to HJ still need to affirm to the [Membership Agreement](https://github.com/rchain/legaldocs/blob/master/Coop%20Membership%20Agreement.pdf), provide their ID, get a Discord Invitation, and request a Live Verification. Each paid activist will be emailed a unique invitation code for Discord. They should reply to this email with a written affirmation of the Member Agreement. They may attach their ID to the email, or provide it during the Live Verification for screen capture by the Verifier to upload to secure storage. On Discord, the user tells the verifier both their email address and unique Discord invite code. The Verifier can now procedeed with the Live Verification procedure above.

**Communication**

[Rchain](https://rchain.coop) has several channels to make easy communication possible within the growing community.
- We work together and keep each other updated through [Github/RChain/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members)
- We've moved from [Slack](https://ourchain.slack.com/messages?) to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/349667445566472202/357561188676009986). Discord has several channels to discuss about all kind of things. The goal is to create actionable issues in [Github/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members/) that are handled by the member-community.
- We're experimenting with [Mattermost](https://rchain.divvydao.net/community/channels/town-square) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/rchain/Rholang) to create insight in who does what when and why.
- The different environments are bridged together. So you would see messages from for example Discord in Mattermost or Gitter.
- We've [Google groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rchain) for interaction through email.
- There's a small [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=rchain%20cooperative) presentation and we're also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rchain_coop)
- We're on [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1747033.0) and a channel on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RChain/)
- There are also weekly conference calls with unedited archives on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSS3jCffMiz574_q64Ukj_w)
- And of course our [website](https://rchain.coop).

**Collaboration**

Through [Github/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members/) issues are created by anyone. It's up to us to handle all those issues in an organized manner, based on self organization and decentralisation. We trust on the skills and common sense to solve the issues and get rewarded in a reasonable way in RHOC.

 - Work items are represented by [issues](https://github.com/rchain/Members/issues/)
   - To make one or join work on one, you need to:
     1. [ ] get/have a [Github account](https://github.com/rchain/Members)
<!--     2. [ ] complete [RChain Activist Registration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSecwGUVFNx_Xa_Qsw5bxLnaKstPS8kQnfrUGqpuf22rLDteDg/viewform) -->
     2. [ ] then confirm the [collaboration invite](https://github.com/rchain/Members/invitations) for the repository [rchain/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members) 
 - Budgets are allocated to work items by at least three Activists. The average of three suggestions defines the budget.
   - [ ] Activist suggests a budget to resolve the issue. Either by adding a comment to the issue in Github or through form [Budget allocation and - spending](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfz-EGexMGPaw0eHwlBBNssQIR5hQCEOsWOZceVrPCo5mjGUA/viewform)
   - [ ] [Operation manager](ops@rchain.coop), Ops will publish the suggestions through [Pub Activist Budget Allocation-Spending](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxuxx8YN17KCIWcH1cUoGuSm2hAnIya2iAc6wxoaq1o/edit#gid=1168839067). By adding comments and email assignments to the cells of the issue in this Gsheet, the allocator will be notified about his/her update.
 - RHOC are distributed monthly based on invoices
   - [ ] During the month each collaborator decides how the budget in RHOC is distributed over the collaborators as a reward for the participation. Either by adding a comment to the issue in Github or through form [Budget allocation and - spending](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfz-EGexMGPaw0eHwlBBNssQIR5hQCEOsWOZceVrPCo5mjGUA/viewform). The average of three reward suggestions set the personal reward for each collaborator. By adding comments and email assignments to the cells of the issue in this Gsheet, the allocator will be notified about his/her update.
   - [ ] At the end of the month the situation will be frozen. No changes can be made anymore to either budgets or rewards. The payment process starts at the beginning of the month. 
   - [ ] The collaborator receives an email with a pre filled invoice and also the needed data if the collaborator wants to make his/her own invoice. The collaborator stores a PDF version of the pre filled invoice or the own invoice in his/her personal [Gdrive of Rchain](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5I9qM5f_1cfeUZoV01EYjdmOEE) Invoices.
   - [ ] The collaborator uses form [Declaration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3ZxbwVL_yQZ7DTSw9V5VZod1U9XeZxDMZB7jupRCnx79erQ/viewform) to announce his/her claim and link to the PDF invoice. If that doesn't work then the invoice can also be emailed.
   - [ ] If the rewards are more then $600 per year, then a [Fw9 tax form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) has to be filled out and stored in the [personal folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5I9qM5f_1cfeUZoV01EYjdmOEE) Tax.
   - [ ] As soon as the [Operation manager](ops@rchain.coop) is notified of the declaration, Ops will transfer RHOC to the provide ETH-addresses.
   - [ ] If an activist does regular work per month, then a Statement of Work has to be set up. This process will be available soon.
   - [ ] Finally management reports reports will be generated and presented in Debriefings of RChain.
   
The first monthly cycle was Aug 2017. [Ops](ops@rchain.coop), (HJ or lapin7) presented this process Aug 30 in
[RChain Community Debrief 40 (24:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Li4g4qDF6M&t=1486s). An overview of the [budgets and rewards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxuxx8YN17KCIWcH1cUoGuSm2hAnIya2iAc6wxoaq1o/edit#gid=1751357908) is available.
