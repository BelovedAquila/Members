# How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need active developers to help this project come to fruition.
We're establishing a community process for Members to earn RHOC working for the coop. See video [24:06 HJ explains Members Decentralized Budgeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Li4g4qDF6M&t=1486s).


**Becoming a Member**

**Process**

- Get a [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) account
- [Sign up](https://member.rchain.coop/#/sign-up) for RChain membership and pay the $20 fee.
- Set a conference call time slot with a representative of RChain cooperative. During the conference call the representative tries to accomplish the 

**4 Membership requirements**:
- [Affirm Membership agreement](https://github.com/rchain/legaldocs/blob/master/Coop%20Membership%20Agreement.pdf)
- Photo of current govt issued ID
- Verified payment of membership fee
- Verify face on live video

**Promotion to MEMBER**

When the 4 Membership Requirements are completed and recorded, a Discord Moderator promotes the user to ROLE=MEMBER and append a ":" to the member's Discord alias for proof of individuality.

**Communication**

[Rchain](https://rchain.coop) has multiple channels to make easy communication possible within the growing community.
- We work together and keep each other updated through [Github/RChain/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members)
- We've moved from [Slack](https://ourchain.slack.com/messages?) to [Discord](https://discordapp.com/channels/349667445566472202/357561188676009986). Discord has several channels to discuss about all kind of things. The goal is to create actionable issues in [Github/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members/) that are handled by the member-community.
- We're experimenting with [Mattermost](https://rchain.divvydao.net/community/channels/town-square) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/rchain/Rholang) to create insight in who does what when and why.
- The different environments are bridged together. So you would see messages from for example Discord in Mattermost or Gitter.
- Telegram [RChain Coop chat group](https://t.me/rchain_coop), Telegram [RChain Coop Official Announcements channel](https://t.me/rchain_official), Telegram [RChain_Official_Chat_CN](https://t.me/RChain_Official_Chat_CN)
- QQ International on channel #RChain...
- We've [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rchain) for interaction through email and getting access to the RChain Google drive and documents.
- There's a small [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/search/top/?q=rchain%20cooperative) presentation and we're also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/rchain_coop)
- We're on [BitcoinTalk](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1747033.0) and a channel on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/RChain_Official/)
- There are weekly conference calls with unedited archives on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSS3jCffMiz574_q64Ukj_w)
- There is a weekly [Member zoom meeting](https://zoom.us/s/197490909) on Wednesdays, 05:00 PM UTC (Amsterdam +2, New York -4, Seattle -7), where we discuss the issues that need to be worked upon.
(https://t.me/Rchain_Official) 
- And of course our [website](https://rchain.coop).

**Collaboration**

Through [Github/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members/) issues are created by anyone. It's up to us to handle all those issues in an organized manner, based on self organization and decentralisation. We trust on the skills and common sense to solve the issues and get rewarded in a reasonable way in RHOC.

 - Work items are represented by [issues](https://github.com/rchain/Members/issues/)
 - To make one or join work on one, you need to:
     1. [ ] get/have a RChain Member [Discord account](https://member.rchain.coop/#/sign-up)
     <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1913335/32598353-e489f158-c539-11e7-9656-4bcbb55718d2.png" alt="Drawing" width="200" />
     
     2. [ ] get/have a [Github account](https://github.com/rchain/Members)
     3. [ ] ask in Discord channel #bounties for Github Member collacoration to get an invite

     4. [ ] then confirm the [collaboration invite](https://github.com/rchain/Members/invitations) for the repository [rchain/Members](https://github.com/rchain/Members) 

**Decentralised Member Budget Allocation**
- Budgets are allocated to work items by at least three Members. The average of three suggestions defines the budget.
- Ops (@lapin7, HJ) explains it in the video [RChain, Decentralized budgeting and spending](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yz-9j4gC9-Q)
- Members suggest a budget to resolve the issue. 
- Go to spreadsheet [Pub Member Budget Allocation-Spending](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxuxx8YN17KCIWcH1cUoGuSm2hAnIya2iAc6wxoaq1o/edit#gid=634479823) TAB "Budget 201711"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1913335/32597438-01a23d84-c537-11e7-916e-c9f12df80480.png)
- Find an issue that you want to allocate a budget to, like #115 "Community Co-Operators"
- Type your Github-name in the yellow column, for example AR66 gets lapin7
- Type your suggested budget, like $5000.00. The current budget becomes then $5000.00 (in K66). It's added to the budget of the previous month.

- [Operation manager](ops@rchain.coop), Ops can also add comments with email assignments to the cells of the issue in this Gsheet in order to stimulate setting budgets.

**Decentralised Member Reward Allocation**
- RHOC are distributed monthly based on invoices
- During the month each collaborator decides how the budget in RHOC is distributed over the collaborators as a reward for the participation. The average of three reward suggestions, set the personal reward for each collaborator.
- Go to spreadsheet [Pub Member Budget Allocation-Spending](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxuxx8YN17KCIWcH1cUoGuSm2hAnIya2iAc6wxoaq1o/edit#gid=634479823) TAB "Rewards 201711"
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1913335/32599161-f91d53f6-c53b-11e7-9ee8-8b31733b98fb.png)
- In column Q and R you see respectively the percentage distribution and the github name of the member, who gave the score according to his/her insight about the work being done by him/her self and the other ones who have done work on the issue
- In column M you can type your github name. Your name appears then in column Q for example.
- In column R you can set then the percentages for your self and the other collaborators
- [Operation manager](ops@rchain.coop), Ops can also add comments with email assignments to the cells of the issue in this Gsheet in order to stimulate setting rewards.
   
**Centralised Payment process**   
- At the end of the month the situation will be frozen. No changes can be made anymore to either budgets or rewards. The payment process starts at the beginning of the month. 
- The collaborator receives an email with a pre filled invoice and also the needed data if the collaborator wants to make his/her own invoice. The collaborator stores a PDF version of the pre filled invoice or the own invoice in his/her personal [Gdrive of Rchain](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5I9qM5f_1cfeUZoV01EYjdmOEE) Invoices.
- The collaborator uses form [Declaration](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe3ZxbwVL_yQZ7DTSw9V5VZod1U9XeZxDMZB7jupRCnx79erQ/viewform) to announce his/her claim and link to the PDF invoice. If that doesn't work then the invoice can also be emailed.
- If a member does regular work per month, then a Statement of Work has to be set up. This process will be available soon.
- If the process works well, then of course it will be decentralised further to work areas or regions.

**Tax**
- RChain Coop has to comply with the tax rules of the IRS. That means that at the end of the year RChain has to provide a list of payouts to members, with the amounts through form 1099.
- If the rewards are more then $600 per year, then a [Fw9 tax form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) has to be filled out and stored in the [personal folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5I9qM5f_1cfeUZoV01EYjdmOEE) Tax.
- For US aliens living outside of the USA, a form [Fw4 tax form](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf) has to be filled out.
- As soon as the [Operation manager](ops@rchain.coop) is notified of the declaration, Ops will transfer RHOC to the provide ETH-addresses.
   
**Reporting**
- Finally management reports reports will be generated and presented in Debriefings of RChain.
   
The first monthly cycle was Aug 2017. [Ops](ops@rchain.coop), (HJ or lapin7) presented this process Aug 30 in
[RChain Community Debrief 40 (24:06)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Li4g4qDF6M&t=1486s). An overview of the [budgets and rewards](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uxuxx8YN17KCIWcH1cUoGuSm2hAnIya2iAc6wxoaq1o/edit#gid=1751357908) is available.
