This repository is meant for all organizational matters, like:
- defining how we work together
- how to become a coop Member
- how to earn RHOC
- etc.

Find us on Slack [#coop](https://ourchain.slack.com/). We want you working on things you're excited about.
Not just code: [Marketing - Content Curation, Creation and Outreach][comm] and any other ways to
support the coop is welcome.
