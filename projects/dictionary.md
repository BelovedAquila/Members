# RChain Nomenclature

    Goal for this document: create a list of RChain words, their definition 
    and linked content in markdown as a github page.
    
    Syntax for editors:
    - Sections get a level 2 heading and subsections (if needed) level 3.
    - Words to be defined should be marked up as a level 4 heading. This 
      basically makes the text bold but also URL-linkable as well as 
      parsable for a future bot.
    - The definition that follows a word is a normal paragraph.

##  RChain General

#### RChain

RChain is a fundamentally new blockchain platform rooted in a formal model of concurrent and decentralized computation. FMI see the [FAQ](https://github.com/rchain/reference/blob/master/faq.md) and the [website](http://rchain.coop/).

#### RChain Platform

The platform is the entire software infrastructure, slated to be released at the end of 2018...

[Agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent) - In computer science, a software agent is a computer program that acts for a user or other program in a relationship of agency, which derives from the Latin - agere (to do): an agreement to act on one's behalf. Such "action on behalf of" implies the authority to decide which, if any, action is appropriate.

[Agent-based model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agent-based_model) - A computational model for simulating the actions and interactions of individuals.

[Bisimilarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisimulation) - In theoretical computer science a bisimulation is a binary relation between state transition systems, associating systems that behave in the same way in the sense that one system simulates the other and vice versa. Intuitively two systems are bisimilar if they match each other's moves. In this sense, each of the systems cannot be distinguished from the other by an observer.

[Bot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_bot) - An Internet bot, also known as web robot, WWW robot or simply bot, is a software application that runs automated tasks (scripts) over the Internet. Typically, bots perform tasks that are both simple and structurally repetitive, at a much higher rate than would be possible for a human alone.

[Chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatbot) - (also known as a talkbot, chatterbot, Bot, IM bot, interactive agent, or Artificial Conversational Entity) is a computer program which conducts a conversation via auditory or textual methods.

[Cyborg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyborg) - (short for "cybernetic organism") is a being with both organic and biomechatronic body part. Cyborg from "cybernetic organsim". Cybernetic from the greek kybernetes which means steersman, governor, pilot, or rudder.

[Formal Methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) - In computer science, specifically software engineering and hardware engineering, formal methods are a particular kind of mathematically based techniques for the specification, development and verification of software and hardware systems.

[Intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent) -  An autonomous, goal-directed entity which observes and acts upon an environment.

[Lambda Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus) - Lambda calculus (also written as Î»-calculus) is a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution.

[Process Calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus) - In computer science, the process calculi (or process algebras) are a diverse family of related approaches for formally modelling concurrent systems.

[Process Algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_calculus) - An algebra is a mathematical structure with a set of values and a set of operations on the values. These operations enjoy algebraic properties such as commutativity, associativity, idempotency, and distributivity. In a typical process algebra, processes are values and parallel composition is defined to be a commutative and associative operation on processes.
