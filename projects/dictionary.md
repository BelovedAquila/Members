# RChain Nomenclature

    Goal for this document: create a list of RChain words, their definition 
    and linked content in markdown as a github page.
    
    Syntax for editors:
    - Sections get a level 2 heading and subsections (if needed) level 3.
    - Words to be defined should be marked up as a level 4 heading. This 
      basically makes the text bold but also URL-linkable as well as 
      parsable for a future bot.
    - The definition that follows a word is a normal paragraph.
